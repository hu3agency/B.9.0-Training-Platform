I will provide you with a brief summary followed by the intended markdown output. Your task is to take the summary and organize the information and provide supplemental information so it logically falls within the questions presented in the markdown output:

Summary: Today is Monday, March 11, 2024. Day 2 in DEG's 28-day beatDrop associated with B.0.9 Onboarding. Yesterday, we identified the risks associated with keeping notes in Google Docs, so today is the first where we will work exclusively in GitHub to ensure we can more easily work with our Open Source AI assistant. Day 2 of B.0.9 Onboarding is "B.0.9.0.1 Train AI Assistant How to Populate an Investment Memo workPad". Yesterday, we taught people how to create an 8-page workpad that they can take with them everywhere. Today, we will teach people how to populate the workPad with an investment memo that will help train their AI Assistnat. The risk that we are overcoming with populating the investment memo workPad is the common challenge passionate creators have: not being able to express their ideas concisely to others. If people can't express their ideas concisely, then it will be harder for them to attract investors in contributors, so with the work we're doing associated with B.0.9.0.1, the aim is to mitigate this risk by providing a rigid structure that enables them to answer 8 questions that force them to focus on the high level items that truly matter to their ecosystem. The final result of all of this will be documentation that we use to improve the effectiveness of Open Source AI Onboarding Assistant personas in a consistent way and maintain a set API based on the Dan Harmon story circle that will be maintained throughout the development of any P3 Ecosystem.

Additionally, we are focused on improving the mechanics of how we manage work across the 10 platforms within a parallel permaculture platform (P3) ecosystem. Yesterday, we created a memo for DEG that highlighted all of the word that we did, but I think it's more appropriate for that to live within hu3agency's GitHub since it acts as the PROVIDER of the ecosystem. This can be thought of the command center. There is a risk that if we put too much information into DEG's Meeting Platform about the entire ecosystem, it will confuse and distract the the OWNER team from the critical tasks associated with their community. The role of the PRODUCER (trainfarb) and PROVIDER (hu3agency) is to operate behind the scenes so that the OWNER can do their job more effectively. After teaching people how to populate their workPad, today is focused on migrating the work we've been doing for the past couple of weeks into a lesson plan that will be managed from the B.0.9.3 Lesson Plans folder within hu3agency's GitHub Repository.

From hu3ageny's repository, we will be able to accept direction from DEG, onboard that information through trainfarb, then distribute the onboarded info to the ecosystem so tasks can be carried out based on agreements set through the governance set by ourStory.
