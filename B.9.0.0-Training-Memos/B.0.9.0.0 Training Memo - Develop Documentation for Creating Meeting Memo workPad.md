 ## Purpose

`What is the purpose of your platform and what is the current state of its development`

The B.0.9 Onboarding Platform focuses on training passionate creators to utilize an Open Source AI Onboarding Assistant, enabling them to express ideas concisely and create compelling content. In tandem, the platform works on refining the P3 Ecosystem's mechanics, addressing challenges faced by creators and enhancing interactions within the ecosystem. Presently, the platform has started implementing rigorous structures to facilitate users in crafting impactful narratives, leveraging the Dan Harmon story circle methodology.

## Problem

`What is the problem associated with today's meeting?`

Many creative minds face difficulty conveying thoughts succinctly, resulting in barriers when seeking investments or contributions. Addressing this issue, the current meeting introduces methods to tackle the challenge head-on by offering a comprehensive strategy focusing on creating an investment memorandum workPad designed for AI Assistant training purposes.

## Solution

`How will this meeting approach a solution?`

The session teaches participants how to populate their pre-existing 8-page workpads with essential details required for constructing an effective investment memo. This hands-on instruction ensures learners absorb best practices for presenting crucial elements clearly, thereby fostering growth in their ability to articulate ideas precisely and engagingly.

## Market

`What risks will this solution help mitigate?`

Implementation of the proposed strategies intends to reduce obstacles in communicating concepts, thus increasing chances of securing funding, garnering support, and amplifying user comprehension. Enabling concise expression allows creators to build stronger connections with target audiences and foster relationships with prospective partners effortlessly.

## Product

`What will be the final result that represents a successful meeting outcome?`

As a successful product of the meeting, participants gain proficiency in filling their workpads with meaningful insights, leading to improved content generation capabilities and increased confidence in sharing ideas. Ultimately, the developed materials will help enhance the Open Source AI Onboarding Assistant persona, promoting uniformity and streamlined interaction across the P3 Ecosystem.

## Distribution

`How will you share the successful meeting outcome with the open source community?`

The results obtained from the meeting will feed directly back into the improvement cycle for the Open Source AI Onboarding Assistant personas, benefiting the wider community. Furthermore, curated lessons learned will benefit the P3 Ecosystem, elevating engagement and reinforcing standards established by the governing body (ourStory).

## Actions

`What metrics and actions are you planning to track as the story of today's work evolves?`

Key measures include evaluating improvements in participant confidence, precision in idea expression, and subsequent feedback received upon presentation. Action steps encompass continuous iteration on the AI Onboarding Assistant personas, adjustments to the B.0.9 Onboarding curriculum, and enhanced coordination between providers (hu3agency) and producers (trainfarb) to cater optimally to the needs of the owner teams.

I will provide you with a brief summary followed by the intended markdown output. Your task is to take the summary and organize the information and provide supplemental information so it logically falls within the questions presented in the markdown output:

Summary: Today is Monday, March 11, 2024. Day 2 in DEG's 28-day beatDrop associated with B.0.9 Onboarding. Yesterday, we identified the risks associated with keeping notes in Google Docs, so today is the first where we will work exclusively in GitHub to ensure we can more easily work with our Open Source AI assistant. Day 2 of B.0.9 Onboarding is "B.0.9.0.1 Train AI Assistant How to Populate an Investment Memo workPad". Yesterday, we taught people how to create an 8-page workpad that they can take with them everywhere. Today, we will teach people how to populate the workPad with an investment memo that will help train their AI Assistnat. The risk that we are overcoming with populating the investment memo workPad is the common challenge passionate creators have: not being able to express their ideas concisely to others. If people can't express their ideas concisely, then it will be harder for them to attract investors in contributors, so with the work we're doing associated with B.0.9.0.1, the aim is to mitigate this risk by providing a rigid structure that enables them to answer 8 questions that force them to focus on the high level items that truly matter to their ecosystem. The final result of all of this will be documentation that we use to improve the effectiveness of Open Source AI Onboarding Assistant personas in a consistent way and maintain a set API based on the Dan Harmon story circle that will be maintained throughout the development of any P3 Ecosystem.

Additionally, we are focused on improving the mechanics of how we manage work across the 10 platforms within a parallel permaculture platform (P3) ecosystem. Yesterday, we created a memo for DEG that highlighted all of the word that we did, but I think it's more appropriate for that to live within hu3agency's GitHub since it acts as the PROVIDER of the ecosystem. This can be thought of the command center. There is a risk that if we put too much information into DEG's Meeting Platform about the entire ecosystem, it will confuse and distract the the OWNER team from the critical tasks associated with their community. The role of the PRODUCER (trainfarb) and PROVIDER (hu3agency) is to operate behind the scenes so that the OWNER can do their job more effectively. After teaching people how to populate their workPad, today is focused on migrating the work we've been doing for the past couple of weeks into a lesson plan that will be managed from the B.0.9.3 Lesson Plans folder within hu3agency's GitHub Repository.

From hu3ageny's repository, we will be able to accept direction from DEG, onboard that information through trainfarb, then distribute the onboarded info to the ecosystem so tasks can be carried out based on agreements set through the governance set by ourStory.
